Dividers tags on their own line within a paragraph block should not be treated as raw dividers:
  setup:
    - setRawBlocks: true
  input: |
    First _line_ of paragraph.
    <br /><br />
    Third *line* of paragraph.
  expect: |
    <p>First <em>line</em> of paragraph.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Third <strong>line</strong> of paragraph.</p>
