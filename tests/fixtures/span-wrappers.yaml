Span tags within square brackets wrappers should be parsed:
  input: |
    [==This *will* not be Textiled.==]

    This is [*strong*] and [_em_].

    Makes possible to have [*span*]tags mid-word.

    Or to *omit* processing mid[==abc *escaped*==]word.

    But otherwise *span*-tags work as normal and are ignored mid-word.

    Quotes work similarly to wrappers, but only wrappers are [*eaten*], {*quotes*} are kept.

    But also quotes{*can*}be used to render spans mid-word.

    bc. Code [==context==] is [*ignored*].
