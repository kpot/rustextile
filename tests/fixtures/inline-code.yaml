Inline code can be used to embed code to a paragraph:
  input: |
    @This is some code@.

    Textile syntax @will *not* _be_ parsed@ within code tags.

    Inline code tags can not have attributes as the content should be displayed as a code:

    @(classname)mitts _*off*_ *_me_*@
    @{text-align:right;}My text@

    Inline code @can spawn across
    *multiple* lines@, but will not generate line break tags.

    Code tags can be wrapped in some glyphs, (@this *is* code@)

    In instances where code tags aren't matched, *[@this _is_ code@]*,
    ==[@square bracket@]== syntax can be used to enforce rendering.

    Instances such as email addresses should tried to be avoided,
    (firstname.lastname)@email.tld (firstname.lastname)@(hostname).tld,
    so that false positives aren't generated.

    In instances where parsing needs to be avoided, textile espacing syntax can be used,
    ==@this is *not* _code_@==, or [==@==]this is *not* [_code_][==@==].

  expect: |
    <p><code>This is some code</code>.</p>

Inline code isn't processed in lite mode:
  setup:
    - setLite: true
  input:  |
    @This would be *some* code@

  expect: |
    <p>@This would be <strong>some</strong> code@</p>
